# ChopBot
This is an bot I made using AutoHotkey to train carpentry in Mabinogi back in 2014-2015 (i think)



This is embarrassing but I actually lost the code for this bot. It was super good too.

Here is some of the features it had
* Chopping wood
* Could detect a dead axe and replace it with one in the inventory
* Takes "breaks" when inventory is full.
* During breaks, the bot can store wood in bank and pets
* During breaks, the bot can repair or buy new axes.
* Could attempt reconnects if player disconnects
* A lot of other things I'm forgetting... This bot literally got me R1 carp while I was at school. 
I used to use remote into my PC off my phone to check on it while in class LOL
